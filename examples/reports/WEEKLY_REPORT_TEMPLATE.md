## Template Structure

```
Week [X] Summary ([date range])
Block: [Name] — Week [X/Y]
Phase: [Base/Build/Peak/Taper/Recovery]

Compliance: [X/X] sessions completed
Planned TSS: [XXX] | Actual TSS: [XXX] ([XX]%)

  Z3 (Grey Zone): [X.X]% (target <5%)
  Z4+ (Quality): [X.X]% (target ~20% of intensity sessions)

Fitness:
  CTL: [XX.X] → [XX.X] (Δ [+/-X.X])

  Sleep: [X.X]h avg, quality [X.X]/5 avg [↑/↓/→]

Section 11 Flags: [list any triggered flags, or "None"]

Overall:
[2-4 sentences — week assessment, compliance, what went well, any flags,
recovery status. Reference Section 11 flag triggers if any were hit.]

Next Week Preview:
[Key sessions planned, any modifications based on this week's data,
focus areas. Reference load targets and phase progression.]

## Field Definitions

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Compliance** | Planned vs completed activities | ✅ completed as planned, ⚠️ modified, ❌ missed |
| **Quality Session Detail** | Hard/intensity sessions only | Matches post-workout report metrics for consistency |
| **Grey Zone %** | Z3 time / total time | Per Seiler — minimize; target <5% of weekly volume |
| **Quality Intensity %** | Z4+ time / total time | The work that drives adaptation |
| **ACWR breakdown** | 7d acute / 28d chronic | Show components so athlete understands the ratio |
| **Wellness arrows** | Week-over-week comparison | ↑ improving, ↓ declining, → stable |
| **Section 11 Flags** | Protocol flag triggers | Surface mid-week flags here, don't wait for block report |
| **Ramp rate** | CTL change per week | >1.5 = aggressive, monitor closely |

## Assessment Labels

| Metric | Good | Watch | Flag |
|--------|------|-------|------|
| ACWR | 0.80–1.30 (optimal) | 1.30–1.50 (elevated) | >1.50 (high risk) |
| Ramp rate | <1.0 (conservative) | 1.0–1.5 (moderate) | >1.5 (aggressive) |
| Grey Zone % | <5% (excellent) | 5–10% (watch) | >10% (too much Z3) |
| Decoupling | <5% (good) | 5–10% (moderate) | >10% (drift) |
| HRV trend | ↑ or → (stable) | ↓ <5% (minor) | ↓ >10% (flag) |

## Notes

- **Session Breakdown** starts on Monday (or user's configured week start)
- **Quality Session Detail** only includes hard/intensity sessions — omit recovery/endurance rides unless metrics were notable. Cap at 2–3 key sessions per week; if 4+ hard days occurred, prioritize sessions with the most notable targets, flags, or breakthroughs
- **Section 11 Flags** should surface immediately in weekly reports, not deferred to block reports
- **Wellness arrows** use simple thresholds: >5% change from previous week = ↑ or ↓, otherwise →
- Keep "Overall" concise — this is coaching interpretation, not data repetition
