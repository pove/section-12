Recovery Index: [X.XX] ([assessment])
Ramp Rate: [X.XX]
Load/Recovery: [X.X] (tolerance [X.X]) — [context note if near edge]
Polarization: Z1+Z2 [XX]%, Z3 [X]%, Z4+ [X]% — [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])

Planned Workouts for Today (Planned TSS: [XXX]):
[WorkoutType] [Duration] — [structure/targets]

[If rest day: "Rest day — no sessions scheduled."]
[If rest day: "Next session: [Day] — [workout preview]"]

Recommendation: [Go / Modify / Skip]

Interpretation:
[Readiness assessment: 1-2 sentences on HRV, RHR, sleep vs baselines]
[Load context: TSB meaning, freshness/fatigue state]
[Suitability: proceed / modify / skip with rationale]
[Coach note: brief motivational or practical tip]

## Conditional Fields

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Weather | Include if athlete location is available via profile or memory |
| Coach note (weather) | Include only if actionable (e.g., dress warm, indoor day) |
| Monotony | Include **only** if > 2.3. Omit entirely when normal |
| Load/Recovery context | Include tolerance note only when within 0.2 of threshold |
| Next session | Include only on rest days |
| Modify/Skip rationale | Required when recommendation is not "Go" |

## Readiness Decision Logic

| Signal | Go | Modify | Skip |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| HRV | Within ±10% of 7d avg | ↓ 10-20% | ↓ >20% |
| RHR | At or below baseline | ↑ 3-4 bpm | ↑ ≥5 bpm |
| Sleep | ≥ 7h, quality ≥ 3/5 | 5-7h or quality 2/5 | < 5h or quality 1/5 |
| TSB | > -15 | -15 to -25 | < -25 |
| ACWR | 0.8–1.3 | 1.3–1.5 | > 1.5 |
| Feel | ≤ 3/5 | 4/5 | ≥ 4/5 + other flags |

> A single amber signal doesn't require modification. **Two or more amber signals** or **any red signal** should trigger Modify or Skip.

## Brevity Rule

- **Normal metrics, Go recommendation:** Keep interpretation to 2-3 sentences
- **Threshold breach or Modify/Skip:** Expand with specific reasoning
- **Rest day:** Brief — confirm recovery status, preview next session
