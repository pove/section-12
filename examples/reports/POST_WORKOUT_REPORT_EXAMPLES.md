Endurance ride cut short at 1.5h of planned 2.5h due to knee discomfort. SkiErg skipped.

Completed workout: VirtualRide Endurance - Monday (modified)
Start time: 10:02:18
Duration: 1.50 hours (planned 2.5h)

Grey Zone (Z3): 0.2%
Quality (Z4+): 0%

Cadence: 86 avg
Decoupling: 1.92 (good)
Variability Index: 1.01 (excellent)
Calories: 800 kcal
Carbs used: 153 g
TSS: 47 (planned 78)

Skipped workout: VirtualSki Training Session
Reason: Precautionary — knee discomfort from ride

Weekly totals:

TSB: +2.35
CTL: 70.50
ATL: 68.15
Ramp rate: -0.30
ACWR: 0.97 (optimal)

Overall:
Session cut short — right call given the knee discomfort. Aerobic quality during the 1.5h
was excellent (decoupling 1.92%, VI 1.00). TSS 47 vs planned 78 means a lighter day than
intended. Monitor knee before tomorrow's session. If persistent, consider swapping to
upper-body only. 🩹
