## Overview

This protocol defines how AI-based coaching systems should reason, query, and provide guidance within an athlete's endurance training ecosystem — ensuring alignment with scientific principles, dossier-defined parameters, and long-term objectives.

It enables AI systems to interpret, update, and guide an athlete's plan even without automated API access, maintaining evidence-based and deterministic logic.

---

### Dossier Architecture Note

Section 11 operates as a **self-contained AI protocol**. All metric definitions, validation ranges, evaluation hierarchies, and decision logic are defined within this document. The athlete's training dossier (DOSSIER.md) is a separate document containing athlete-specific data, goals, and configuration.

| Content Type | Location | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Phase Detection Triggers | Section 11 (11A) | AI-specific classification logic |
| Validated Endurance Ranges | Section 11 (11A, subsection 7) | Audit thresholds within AI protocol |
| Load Management Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI decision logic |
| Periodisation Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI coaching logic |
| Durability Sub-Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI diagnostic logic |
| W′ Balance Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI optional metrics |
| Plan Adherence Monitoring | Section 11 (11A) | AI compliance tracking |
| Specificity Volume Tracking | Section 11 (11A) | AI event-prep logic |
| Benchmark Index | Section 11 (11A, FTP Governance) | AI longitudinal tracking |
| Zone Distribution Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI intensity monitoring |
| Seiler TID Classification | Section 11 (11A, Zone Distribution) | AI TID classification and drift detection |
| Aggregate Durability | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI durability trend tracking |
| Capability Metrics | Section 11 (11A, subsection 9) | AI capability-layer analysis (durability + TID comparison) |
| Validation Metadata | Section 11 (11C) | AI audit schema |

AI systems should reference the athlete dossier for athlete-specific values (FTP, zones, goals, schedule) and this protocol for all coaching logic, thresholds, and decision rules.

## 11 A. AI Coach Protocol (For LLM-Based Coaching Systems)

### Purpose

This protocol defines how an AI model should interact with an athlete's training data, apply validated endurance science, and make determinate, auditable recommendations — even without automated data sync from platforms like Intervals.icu, Garmin Connect, or Concept2 Logbook.

If the AI instance does not retain prior context (e.g., new chat or session), it must first reload the dossier, confirm current FTP, HRV, RHR, and phase before providing advice.

#### Data Mirror Integration

If the AI or LLM system is not directly or indirectly connected to the Intervals.icu API, it may reference an athlete-provided public data mirror.

**Example endpoint format:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[username]/[repo]/main/latest.json
```

**Example archive format:**
```
https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/tree/main/archive
```

**Example history format:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[username]/[repo]/main/history.json
```

> **Note:** The actual URLs for your data mirror are defined in your athlete dossier. The AI must fetch from the dossier-specified endpoint.

This file represents a synchronized snapshot of current Intervals.icu metrics and activity summaries, structured for deterministic AI parsing and audit compliance.

The JSON endpoint is considered a **Tier-1 verified mirror** of Intervals.icu and inherits its trust priority in the Data Integrity Hierarchy. All metric sourcing and computation must reference it deterministically, without modification or estimation.

If the data appears stale or outdated, the AI must explicitly request a data refresh before providing recommendations or generating analyses.

#### History Data Mirror (history.json)

In addition to the real-time `latest.json` mirror, athletes may provide a `history.json` file containing longitudinal training data with tiered granularity:

- **90-day tier:** Daily resolution (date, hours, TSS, CTL/ATL/TSB, HRV, RHR, zone distribution, weight)
- **180-day tier:** Weekly aggregates (hours, TSS, CTL/ATL/TSB, zones, hard days, longest ride)
- **1/2/3-year tiers:** Monthly aggregates (hours, TSS, CTL range, zones, phase, data completeness)
- **FTP timeline:** Every FTP change with date and type (indoor/outdoor)
- **Data gaps:** Periods with missing or low data, flagged factually without inference

`history.json` is auto-generated by sync.py when missing or stale (>28 days), pulling fresh from the Intervals.icu API.

#### Data Source Usage Hierarchy

| Source | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `latest.json` | Current state — readiness, load, go/modify/skip decisions | **Always primary.** All immediate coaching decisions use this. |
| `history.json` | Longitudinal context — trends, seasonal patterns, phase transitions | **Context only.** Reference when questions require historical depth. |

**Rules:**
1. `latest.json` is always primary. All immediate coaching decisions (readiness, load prescription, go/modify/skip) use `latest.json`.
2. `history.json` is context, never override. It informs interpretation but never overrides current readiness signals.
3. Reference `history.json` for: trend questions, seasonal pattern matching, phase transition decisions, FTP/Benchmark interpretation, and when data confidence is limited.
4. Do NOT reference `history.json` for: daily pre/post workout reports (unless investigating), simple go/modify/skip decisions where readiness is clear, or any time `latest.json` provides a definitive answer on its own.

### Rolling Phase Logic

Training follows the **URF v5.1 Rolling Phase Model**, which classifies weekly load and recovery trends into evolving blocks — **Base → Build → Peak → Taper → Recovery** — derived directly from the interaction of these scientific models:

- **Banister (1975):** Fitness–fatigue impulse–response system for CTL/ATL/TSB dynamics
- **Seiler (2010, 2019):** Polarized intensity and adaptation rhythm
- **Issurin (2008):** Block periodization (accumulation → realization → taper)
- **Gabbett (2016):** Acute:Chronic workload ratio for safe progression

Each week's data (TSS, CTL, ATL, TSB, RI) is analyzed for trend and slope:

| **Metric**                | **Purpose**                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| ΔTSS % (Ramp Rate)        | Week-to-week load change                 |
| CTL / ATL Slope           | Long- and short-term stress trajectories |
| TSB                       | Readiness and recovery balance           |
| ACWR (0.8–1.3)            | Safe workload progression                |
| Recovery Index (RI ≥ 0.8) | Fatigue–recovery equilibrium             |

This produces a rolling phase block structure that adapts dynamically, ensuring progression and recovery follow real-world readiness rather than fixed calendar blocks.
The system continuously reflects the athlete’s true state — evolving naturally through accumulation, stabilization, and adaptation phases.

### Phase Detection Criteria

To ensure deterministic phase classification, AI systems must evaluate the following trigger conditions when identifying the current training phase:

| **Phase** | **Primary Triggers** | **Supporting Indicators** |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Base | CTL rising steadily, ACWR 0.8–1.0, Quality Intensity <15% (by time) or ≤1 hard day/week | Polarisation index ≥0.85, RI ≥0.8, Grey Zone <5% |
| Build | ACWR 1.0–1.3, Quality Intensity 15–25% (by time) or 2 hard days/week | CTL slope positive, TSB neutral to slightly negative, Grey Zone <8% |
| Peak | CTL plateau or slight decline, interval intensity at maximum | Specificity Score ≥0.85, TSB trending positive, 2–3 hard days/week |
| Overreached | ACWR >1.3 OR Strain >3500 OR RI <0.6 for ≥3 days | HRV ↓>15%, Feel ≥4, Monotony >2.5 |
| Taper | CTL declining 5–15%, TSB rising toward positive | Volume reduction 30–50%, intensity maintained, 1–2 hard days/week |
| Recovery | TSB >+10, weekly load <50% of 4-week average | RI ≥0.85, HRV stable or improving, 0 hard days |

**Phase Transition Rules:**
- Phase changes require ≥3 consecutive days of trigger conditions being met
- Overreached state triggers immediate phase reassessment regardless of planned block
- AI must cite specific trigger values when declaring phase transitions

---

### Zone Distribution & Polarisation Metrics

To ensure accurate intensity structure tracking across power and heart-rate data, the protocol aligns with **URF v5.1's Zone Distribution and Polarization Model**.

This system applies Seiler's 3-zone endurance framework (Z1 = < LT1, Z2 = LT1–LT2, Z3 = > LT2) to all recorded sessions and computes both power- and HR-based polarization indices.

|**Metric**                        | **Formula / Model**                     | **Source / Theory**                            | **Purpose / Interpretation**                                     |
| ---------------------------------| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Polarization (Power-based)       | (Z1 + Z3) / (2 × Z2)                    | Seiler & Kjerland (2006); Seiler (2010, 2019)  | Balances easy vs. moderate vs. hard; higher = more polarized     |   				 
| Polarization Index (Normalized)  | (Z1 + Z2) / (Z1 + Z2 + Z3)              | Stöggl & Sperlich (2015)                       | Quantifies aerobic share; 0.7–0.8 = optimal aerobic distribution |   
| Polarization Fused (HR + Power)  | (Z1 + Z3) / (2 × Z2) across HR + Power  | Seiler (2019)                                  | Validates intensity pattern when combining HR and power sources  |  
| Polarization Combined (All-Sport)| (Z1 + Z2) / Total zone time (HR + Power)| Foster et al. (2001); Seiler & Tønnessen (2009)| Global endurance load structure; ≥ 0.8 = strongly polarized      |
| Training Monotony Index          | Mean Load / SD(Load)                    | Foster (1998)                             | Evaluates load variation; high values = risk of uniformity or overuse |

**Simple Polarisation Index** (used in `derived_metrics.polarisation_index`):
- Formula: `(Z1 + Z2) / Total zone time` — a 0–1 ratio of easy time
- Target: ≥0.80 for polarized training
- This is a quick sanity check for 80/20 compliance

**Seiler & Kjerland Interpretation** (theoretical reference — not used for TID classification):
- Polarization ratio > 1.0 → Polarized distribution
- Polarization ratio ≈ 0.7–0.9 → Pyramidal distribution
- Polarization ratio < 0.6 → Threshold-heavy distribution

For quantitative TID classification, the protocol uses the **Treff Polarization Index** described below.

By combining HR- and power-based zone data, the athlete's intensity structure remains accurately tracked across all disciplines, ensuring consistency between indoor and outdoor sessions.

---

#### Seiler TID Classification System

The data mirror provides a complete **Training Intensity Distribution (TID)** classification using the Treff et al. (2019) Polarization Index and a 5-class system based on Seiler's 3-zone model.

**Zone Mapping (7-Zone → Seiler 3-Zone):**

| 7-Zone Model | Seiler Zone | Classification | Notes                                                     |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Z1–Z2        | Zone 1      | Easy           | Below LT1/VT1 (<2mM lactate)                              |
| Z3           | Zone 2      | Grey Zone      | Between LT1 and LT2 — minimize in polarized training      |
| Z4–Z7        | Zone 3      | Hard/Quality   | Above LT2/VT2 (>4mM lactate)                              |

**Treff Polarization Index (PI):**

```
PI = log10((Z1 / Z2) × Z3 × 100)
```

Where Z1, Z2, Z3 are fractional time in each Seiler zone (0–1).

**Computation Rules:**
- Only compute when Z1 > Z3 > Z2 and Z3 ≥ 0.01 (polarized structure required)
- If Z2 = 0 but structure is polarized: substitute Z2 = 0.01 (avoids division by zero)
- Otherwise: return null (PI is not meaningful for non-polarized distributions)

**5-Class TID Classifier** (explicit priority order, evaluated top-to-bottom):

| Priority | Classification   | Condition                                      |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Base             | Z3 < 0.01 and Z1 is largest zone               |
| 2        | Polarized        | Z1 > Z3 > Z2 and PI > 2.0                      |
| 3        | Pyramidal        | Z1 > Z2 > Z3                                   |
| 4        | Threshold        | Z2 is largest zone                              |
| 5        | High Intensity   | Z3 is largest zone                              |

If no condition matches (e.g., polarized structure but PI ≤ 2.0), classify as Pyramidal.

**Dual Calculation:** TID is computed twice — for all sports combined and for the primary sport only (like monotony). This catches cases where multi-sport training inflates easy time.

**Dual-Timeframe TID (7d vs 28d):**

The data mirror provides both 7-day (acute) and 28-day (chronic) Seiler TID classifications:
- `seiler_tid_7d` / `seiler_tid_7d_primary` — current week's distribution
- `seiler_tid_28d` / `seiler_tid_28d_primary` — 28-day chronic distribution

The `capability.tid_comparison` object compares these windows to detect distribution drift:

| Drift Category          | Condition                                        | Severity |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| consistent              | 7d and 28d classification match                  | —        |
| shifting                | 7d and 28d classification differ                 | warning  |
| acute_depolarization    | 7d PI < 2.0 AND 28d PI ≥ 2.0                    | warning  |

`pi_delta` (7d PI minus 28d PI) quantifies the magnitude — positive means more polarized acutely.

**AI Response Logic:**
- `consistent` → No mention needed in reports
- `shifting` → Note in weekly report; investigate if sustained >2 weeks
- `acute_depolarization` → Flag in pre-workout and weekly reports; likely indicates fatigue shifting distribution toward grey zone
- TID drift is a **Tier 3 diagnostic** — it informs coaching context, not go/no-go decisions

### Behavioral & Analytical Rules for AI Coaches

#### 1. Deterministic Guidance (No Virtual Math)

All numeric references (FTP, HRV, RHR, TSS, CTL, ATL, HR zones) must use the athlete's provided or most recently logged values — no estimation, interpolation, or virtual math is permitted.

If the AI does not have a current value, it must request it from the user explicitly.

**Tolerances:**
- Power: ±1% for rounding (not inference)
- Heart Rate: ±1 bpm for rounding (not inference)
- HRV / RHR: No tolerance (use exact recent values)

**FTP Governance:**
- FTP is governed by modeled MLSS via Intervals.icu; passive updates reflect validated endurance trends (no discrete FTP testing required)
- FTP tests are optional — one or two per year may be performed for validation or benchmarking
- AI systems must not infer or overwrite FTP unless validated by modeled data or explicit athlete confirmation

**Benchmark Index (Longitudinal FTP Validation):**

To track FTP progression without requiring discrete tests, AI systems may compute:

```
Benchmark Index = (FTP_current ÷ FTP_prior) − 1
```

Where:
- `FTP_current` = Current modeled FTP from Intervals.icu
- `FTP_prior` = FTP value from 8–12 weeks prior (captures 1–1.5 training cycles)

**Interpretation:**
| **Benchmark Index** | **Status**  | **Recommended Action**                                      |
|---------------------|------------ |-------------------------------------------------------------|
| +2% to +5%          | Progressive | Continue current programming                                |
| 0% to +2%           | Maintenance | Acceptable if in recovery or maintenance phase              |
| −2% to 0%           | Plateau     | Review training stimulus and recovery                       |
| < −2%               | Regression  | Investigate recovery, illness, overtraining, or life stress |

**⚠️ Seasonal Context Adjustment:**

Benchmark Index interpretation must account for seasonal training phases. Expected FTP fluctuations vary across the annual cycle:

| **Season / Phase**           | **Expected Benchmark Index** | **Notes**                                           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Off-season (post-goal event) | −5% to −2%                   | Expected regression during recovery; not concerning |
| Early Base (winter)          | −2% to +1%                   | Maintenance or slow rebuild; normal                 |
| Late Base / Build (spring)   | +2% to +5%                   | Progressive gains expected                          |
| Peak / Race Season (summer)  | +1% to +3%                   | Gains taper as fitness plateaus near peak           |
| Transition (autumn)          | −3% to 0%                    | Controlled detraining; expected                     |

**Interpretation Rules:**
- A −3% Benchmark Index in January (post off-season) is **normal** and should not trigger alarm
- A −3% Benchmark Index in July (mid-season) **warrants investigation**
- AI systems should cross-reference current phase (from Phase Detection Criteria) before flagging regression
- If Benchmark Index is negative but within seasonal expectations, note as "expected seasonal variance" rather than "regression"

**Governance Rules:**
- Benchmark Index should be evaluated no more frequently than every 4 weeks
- Negative trends persisting >8 weeks *outside expected seasonal context* warrant programme review
- AI must not use Benchmark Index to override athlete-confirmed FTP values

**Computational Consistency:**
- All computations must maintain deterministic consistency
- Variance across total or aggregated metrics must not exceed ±1% across datasets
- No smoothing, load interpolation, or virtual recomputation of totals is allowed — only event-based (workout-level) summations are valid
- Weekly roll-ups must reconcile with logged data totals within ±1% tolerance

### AI Self-Validation Checklist

Before providing recommendations, AI systems must verify:

| #  | **Check**                        | **Deterministic Rules/Requirement**.                                                                                                                   |
|----|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0  | **Data Source Fetch**            | Fetch JSON from mirror URL FIRST. If fetch fails or data unavailable, STOP and request manual data input.                                              |
| 1  | FTP Source Verification          | Confirm FTP/LT2 is explicitly athlete-provided or from API or JSON mirror. Do not infer or recalculate from performance history.                       |
| 2  | Data Consistency Check           | Verify weekly training hours and load totals match the “READ_THIS_FIRST → quick_stats” dataset. Confirm totals within ±1% tolerance of logged data     |             
| 3  | No Virtual Math Policy           | Ensure all computed metrics originate from raw or mirrored data. No interpolation, smoothing, or estimation permitted.                                 |
| 4  | Tolerance Compliance             | Recommendations must remain within: ±3 W power, ±1 bpm HR, ±1% dataset variance.                                                                       |
| 5  | Missing-Data Handling            | If a metric is unavailable or outdated, explicitly request it from athlete. Never assume or project unseen values.                                     |
| 6  | Temporal Data Validation         | Verify "last_updated" timestamp is <24 hours old. If data is >48 hours, request a refresh. Flag if athlete context (illness, travel) contradicts data. |               
| 6b | UTC Time Synchronization         | Confirm dataset and system clocks align to UTC. Flag if offset >60 min or timestamps appear ahead of query time.                                       |
| 7  | Multi-Metric Conflict Resolution | If HRV/RHR ≠ Feel/RPE, prioritize athlete-provided readiness. Note discrepancy, request clarification. Never override illness/fatigue with “good” TSB. |
| 8  | Recommendation Auditability      | Cite specific data points used. Include reasoning chain. State confidence: "High" (all data) / "Medium" (1–2 gaps) / "Low" (>2 gaps).                  |
| 9  | Rolling Phase Alignment          | Identify current phase from TSB trend and ramp rate. Recommendations must align with phase logic. Flag contradictions.                                 |
| 10 | Protocol Version & Framework Citations | State Section 11 version. Cite frameworks when applying logic (e.g., "Per Seiler 80/20 model..."). Include framework version (e.g., “URF v5.1”)  |                                        

---


### Plan Adherence Monitoring

AI systems should track prescription compliance to validate coaching effectiveness:

**Consistency Index Calculation:**
```
Consistency Index = Sessions Completed ÷ Sessions Planned (rolling 7-day window)
```

**Compliance Thresholds:**
| **Consistency Index** | **Status**    | **AI Response**                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ≥0.9                  | Compliant     | Continue current prescription                             |
| 0.7–0.89              | Partial       | Flag missed sessions; assess barriers                     |
| <0.7                  | Non-compliant | Review prescription feasibility; adjust load or frequency |

**Validation Rules:**
- Planned sessions are defined by the athlete's calendar or AI-prescribed plan
- Rest days count as "completed" if no workout was prescribed
- Partial session completion (e.g., cut short) counts as 0.5 for calculation purposes
- AI must not penalise recovery adjustments made in response to readiness signals

---

### Intervals.icu Execution Tolerance (Indoor Variance Handling)

When comparing planned versus executed power targets, indoor workouts typically exhibit a consistent offset of approximately −2 to −3 W due to calibration variance, drivetrain loss, temperature, and real-time power averaging.

This minor deviation falls within deterministic tolerance and does not constitute underperformance.

AI systems must evaluate compliance within **±3 W or ±1%** of the prescribed target for each structured interval and total session.

**Example:** A target of 258 W resulting in 255–256 W average is considered fully compliant.

---

### Interval Contextualization Rule

AI systems must interpret interval power targets within their specific work segments — not as expectations for the entire session average.

Structured workouts (e.g., 4 × 10 min @ 258–261 W) include warm-up, recovery, and transition phases that naturally reduce overall session averages.
Performance evaluation must therefore be phase-aware and based on interval-level intent rather than total-session output.

**Compliance validation should include:**
- Comparing each interval's mean power to its prescribed target (±3 W or ±1%)
- Confirming session-level NP and TSS align with expected aggregate values
- Avoiding misclassification of sessions as "underperformed" solely due to lower total averages

---

### 2. Explicit Data Requests

Before querying the athlete manually, the AI should first verify whether the metric is already present or up-to-date in the API or JSON data mirror.

If unavailable, request:

| **Metric Needed** | **Ask For**                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FTP / LT2 Power   | "What's your current FTP or LT2 from Intervals.icu?"                        |
| HRV / RHR         | "What's your latest HRV and resting heart rate?"                            |
| CTL / ATL / Form  | "Can you share your current fitness, fatigue, and form from Intervals.icu?" |
| Sleep / Readiness | "How was your last night's sleep and morning readiness?"                    |
| Recent Workouts   | "Can you provide your last 7 days of training summaries or key sessions?"   |

AI should also prompt for *subjective recovery markers*: recent RPE, mood, sleep quality, fatigue, soreness, or stress level. 
Reference alongside objective metrics when evaluating readiness, recovery, or adaptations.

---

### 3. Context Integrity

All advice must respect current dossier targets and progression logic. No training adjustments should violate:
- Weekly volume tolerance
- Polarisation ratio (80/20 intensity)
- Planned block phasing

---

### 4. Temporal Awareness

If a conversation occurs outside planned training blocks (e.g., holidays, deloads, illness), AI must re-anchor guidance to current health and readiness first before referencing long-term progression targets.

---

### 5. Communication Style

AI systems must adopt a professional coach tone — concise, precise, and data-driven. Avoid speculation, filler, or motivational hype.

When uncertain, the AI must ask, not assume.

**Post-Workout Report Structure:**

Reports use a structured line-by-line format per session, not bullet-point summaries. Each report follows this flow:

1. **Data timestamp:** `Data (last_updated UTC: [timestamp])`
2. **One-line summary:** What was completed, key observation
3. **Session block(s)** (one per activity, line-by-line):
   - Activity type & name
   - Start time
   - Duration (actual vs planned)
   - Distance (cycling/running only)
   - Power: Avg / NP
   - Power zones (% breakdown)
   - Grey Zone (Z3): X%
   - Quality (Z4+): X%
   - HR: Avg / Max
   - HR zones (% breakdown)
   - Cadence (avg)
   - Decoupling (with assessment label)
   - Variability Index (with assessment label)
   - Calories (kcal)
   - Carbs used (g)
   - TSS (actual vs planned)
   Omit fields only if data unavailable for that activity type.
4. **Weekly totals block:** Polarization, Durability (7d/28d + trend), TID 28d (+ drift), TSB, CTL, ATL, Ramp rate, ACWR, Hours, TSS
5. **Overall:** Coach note (2–4 sentences — compliance, key quality observations, load context, recovery note if applicable)

See **Output Format Guidelines** for full field reference, assessment labels, and report templates.

**Do NOT:**
- Use single-paragraph responses for workout reviews
- Use bullet-point lists for session data (use structured line-by-line format)
- Ask follow-up questions when data is complete and metrics are good
- Omit weekly totals (polarization, durability, TID 28d, TSB, CTL, ATL, ACWR, hours, TSS)
- Cite "per Section 11" or "according to the protocol"

Elaborate only when thresholds are breached or athlete requests deeper analysis.

---

### 6. Recommendation Formatting

Present actionable guidance in concise, prioritized lists (3–5 items maximum).

Each recommendation must be specific, measurable, and data-linked:
- "Maintain ≥70% Z1–Z2 time this week."
- "If RI < 0.7 for 3 days, shift next 3 sessions to recovery emphasis."
- “FTP reassessments are not scheduled.”

Avoid narrative advice or motivational filler.

---

### 7. Data Audit and Validation

Before issuing any performance analysis or training adjustment, validate key data totals with the athlete.

If figures appear inconsistent or incomplete, request confirmation before proceeding.

When validating datasets, cross-check computed fatigue and load ratios against validated endurance ranges:
**Validated Endurance Ranges:**

| **Metric**                   | **Valid Range**                                    | **Flag (Early Warning)**           | **Alarm (Action Needed)**           | **Notes**                                                           |

**Monotony Deload Context:**  
Monotony may be mathematically elevated during and 2–3 days after a deload week due to uniform low-load sessions in the 7-day rolling window. This is a structural artifact, not an overuse signal. When trailing 7-day TSS is ≥20% below the 28-day weekly average, monotony alerts should include context indicating the elevation is expected and will normalize as the window rolls forward. AI systems must not prescribe load changes based on deload-context monotony alone.

**⚠️ Load-Recovery Ratio Hierarchy Note:**  
Load-Recovery Ratio is a **secondary** overreach detector. It should only be evaluated *after* Recovery Index (RI) has been validated as the primary readiness marker. The decision hierarchy is:

1. **Primary:** Recovery Index (RI) — physiological readiness
2. **Secondary:** Load-Recovery Ratio — load vs. recovery capacity
3. **Tertiary:** Subjective markers (Feel, RPE) — athlete-reported state

If RI indicates good readiness (≥0.8) but Load-Recovery Ratio is elevated (≥2.5), flag for monitoring but do not auto-trigger deload unless RI also declines.


If any values breach limits, shift guidance toward load modulation or recovery emphasis.

---

### Data Integrity Hierarchy (Trust Order)

If multiple data sources conflict:

1. **Intervals.icu API** → Primary source for power, HRV, CTL/ATL, readiness metrics
2. **Intervals.icu JSON Mirror** → Verified Tier-1 mirror source (read-only reference)
3. **Garmin Connect** → Backup for HR, sleep, RHR
4. **Athlete-provided data** → Valid if recent (<7 days) and stated explicitly
5. **Dossier Baselines** → Fallback reference

---

### 8. Readiness & Recovery Thresholds

Monitor and respond to:

| **Trigger**   | **Response**                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| HRV ↓ > 20%   | Easy day or deload consideration  |
| RHR ↑ ≥ 5 bpm | Flag potential fatigue or illness |
| Feel ≥ 4/5    | Adjust volume 30–40% for 3–4 days |

**Recovery Index Formula:**
```
RI = (HRV_today / HRV_baseline) ÷ (RHR_today / RHR_baseline)
```

**Interpretation:**
- RI ≥ 0.8 = Good readiness
- RI 0.6–0.79 = Moderate fatigue
- RI < 0.6 = Deload required

**RI Trend Monitoring:**
- 7-day mean should remain ≥ 0.8 for progression weeks
- If RI < 0.7 for > 1 day → flag for monitoring (early warning)
- If RI < 0.7 for > 3 consecutive days → trigger block-level deload or load-modulation review
- If RI < 0.6 → immediate deload required regardless of duration

AI systems must only consider caloric-reduction or weight-optimization phases during readiness-positive windows (DI ≥ 0.95, HR drift ≤ 3 %, RI ≥ 0.8), referencing Section 8 — Weight Adjustment Control.

---

### TSB Interpretation

**General Guidance:**
- TSB −10 to −30: **Typically normal** — reflects training load exceeding recent baseline
- TSB < −30: Monitor closely; check for compounding fatigue signals
- TSB > +10: Extended recovery surplus; may indicate under-training or planned taper

**Negative TSB is expected when:**
- Training consistently (any phase)
- Returning from off-season, illness, or holiday
- Intentionally building load

**Recovery recommendations based on TSB alone are NOT warranted** unless accompanied by:
- HRV ↓ > 20%
- RHR ↑ ≥ 5 bpm
- Feel ≥ 4/5
- Performance decline

A negative TSB is the mechanism of adaptation, not a warning signal.

---

### Success & Progression Triggers

In addition to recovery-based deload conditions, AI systems must detect readiness for safe workload, intensity, or interval progression ("green-light" criteria).

#### Readiness Thresholds (All Must Be Met)

| **Metric**            | **Threshold**                           |

### Event-Specific Volume Tracking (Peak Phase Only)

During peak and pre-competition phases, AI systems should validate event-specific volume allocation using the Specificity Volume Ratio:

**Specificity Volume Ratio Calculation:**
```
Specificity Volume Ratio = Race-specific Training Hours ÷ Total Training Hours (rolling 14–21 days)
```

**Race-Specific Definition by Event Type:**

The definition of "race-specific" training varies by event type. AI systems should reference **Section 3 (Training Schedule & Framework)** for athlete-specific event definitions, or apply the following defaults:

| **Event Type**           | **Race-Specific Definition**                             | **Duration Tolerance**    | **Rationale**                                                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gran Fondo / Randonneur  | Sessions matching target event duration and pacing       | ±15%                      | Duration-critical; pacing and fueling are primary limiters              |
| Road Race (mass start)   | Sessions with race-specific power variability and surges | ±20%                      | Tactical demands vary; power profile more important than exact duration |
| Time Trial               | Sessions at target TT intensity and duration             | ±10%                      | Highly duration- and intensity-specific                                 |
| Criterium / Track        | High-intensity intervals matching race power demands     | N/A (power-profile based) | Duration less relevant; power repeatability is key                      |
| Ultra-Endurance (200km+) | Long rides ≥70% of event duration at target pacing       | ±10%                      | Duration, pacing, and fueling are critical                              |
| Hill Climb               | Efforts matching target climb duration and gradient      | ±15%                      | Power-to-weight at specific duration                                    |

**Volume Allocation Targets:**
| **Phase** | **Specificity Volume Ratio** | **Specificity Score (existing)** |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Base      | 0.2–0.4                      | N/A (general fitness focus)      |
| Build     | 0.4–0.6                      | ≥0.70                            |
| Peak      | 0.7–0.9                      | ≥0.85                            |

**AI Response Logic:**
- If Specificity Volume Ratio <0.5 within 3 weeks of goal event → Flag insufficient event-specific volume
- If Specificity Score ≥0.85 but Specificity Volume Ratio <0.6 → Quality good but volume insufficient; increase race-specific session frequency
- If Specificity Volume Ratio >0.9 for >2 weeks → Risk of monotony; validate variety while maintaining specificity

**Note:** For events not listed above, AI should prompt athlete to define race-specific criteria or reference Section 3 event profile.

### Progression Pathways

Apply One at a Time — Some phases may run concurrently with readiness validation.

**Concurrency Rules:**
- *Progression Pathways 1 and 2* may progress simultaneously if recovery stability is confirmed (RI ≥ 0.8, HRV within 10 %, no negative fatigue trend).  
- *Progression Pathways 2 and 3* may overlap when readiness is high (RI ≥ 0.85, HRV stable, no recent load spikes).  
- *Progression Pathways 1 and 3* must not overlap — avoid combining long-endurance load with metabolic or environmental stressors.  
- Only one progression variable per category may be modified per week.

#### *1 Endurance Progression (Z1–Z2 Durability Work)

**Phase A — Duration Extension:**
- Extend long endurance rides by 5–10% until target duration achieved
- Maintain HR drift < 5% and RI ≥ 0.8 during extension

**Phase B — Power Transition (Duration Reached):**
- Once target duration sustained with DI ≥ 0.97, maintain duration but increase aerobic/tempo targets by +2–3% (≤ 5 W typical)
- Confirm HR drift < 5% and RI ≥ 0.8 for two consecutive sessions before further increase

#### *2 Structured Interval Progression (VO₂max / Sweet Spot Days)

**Readiness Check (All Required):**
- RI ≥ 0.8 and stable (no downward trend >3 days)
- HRV within 10% of baseline
- Prior interval compliance ≥ 95% (actual NP vs. target NP ±3 W)

**VO₂max Sessions:**
- Prioritize power progression, not duration
- Increase target power by +2–3% (≤ +5 W) once full set compliance maintained with consistent recovery (HR rise between reps < 10 bpm)
- Extend total sets only when power targets sustainable and RI ≥ 0.85 for ≥ 3 consecutive workouts
- Cap total weekly VO₂max time at ≤ 45 min

**Sweet Spot Sessions:**
- Progress by increasing target power +2–3% after two consecutive weeks of stable HR recovery (< 10 bpm drift between intervals)
- Maintain total session time unless HR drift or RPE indicates clear under-load

#### *3 Metabolic & Environmental Progression (Optional Advanced Phase)

Once duration and interval stability confirmed, controlled metabolic or thermoregulatory stressors may be introduced:
- Higher carbohydrate intake (CHO/h) for fueling efficiency validation
- Heat exposure or altitude simulation for environmental resilience
- Fasted-state Z2 validation for enhanced metabolic flexibility

**Rules:**
- Only one progression variable may be modified per week
- Exposures must not exceed one per 7–10 days
- Additional exposures require RI ≥ 0.85 and HRV within 10% of baseline

---

### Regression Rule (Safety Check)

This rule applies exclusively to structured interval sessions (Sweet Spot, Threshold, VO₂max, Anaerobic, Neuromuscular work) — not to general endurance, recovery, or metabolic progression blocks.

It governs acute, session-level performance safety, ensuring localized overreach is corrected before systemic fatigue develops.

**Triggers:**
- Intra-session HR recovery worsens by >15 bpm between intervals
- RPE rises ≥2 points at constant power

**Response:**
- Classify as acute overreach.  
- For minor deviations (isolated fatigue signals or transient HR drift), insert **1–2 days of Z1-only training** to restore autonomic stability.  
- If fatigue persists after 2 days (HR recovery >15 bpm or RPE +2), revert next interval session to prior week’s load or reduce volume 30–40% for 3–4 days.
- Maintain normal Z2 endurance unless global readiness metrics also indicate systemic fatigue (RI < 0.7 for >3 days, HRV ↓ > 20%)

---

### Recovery Metrics Integration (HRV / RHR / Sleep / Feel)

**Purpose:** Provide a deterministic readiness validation layer linking daily recovery data to training adaptation.

**Key Variables:**
- HRV (ms): 7-day rolling baseline comparison
- RHR (bpm): 7-day rolling baseline comparison
- Sleep Score: Platform composite (0–100)
- Feel (1–5): Manual subjective entry

**Decision Logic:**
- HRV ↓ > 20% vs baseline → Active recovery / easy spin
- RHR ↑ ≥ 5 bpm vs baseline → Fatigue / illness flag
- Sleep Score < 60 → Reduce next-session intensity by 1 zone
- Feel ≥ 4 → Treat as low readiness; monitor for compounding fatigue  
- Feel ≥ 4 + 1 trigger (HRV, RHR, or Sleep deviation) → Insert 1–2 days of Z1-only training
- 1 trigger persisting ≥2 days → Insert 1–2 days of Z1-only training
- ≥ 2 triggers → Auto-deload (−30–40% volume × 3–4 days)

**Integration:**
Daily metrics synchronised through data hierarchy and mirrored in JSON dataset each morning. AI-coach systems must reference latest values before prescribing or validating any session.

If HRV unavailable, "Feel" substitutes as primary readiness indicator.

---

### Audit and Determinism Notes

- Each progression must include an explicit “trigger met” reference in AI or coaching logs (e.g., RI ≥ 0.85, DI ≥ 0.97) to preserve deterministic audit traceability.
- Power increases should not exceed +3 % per week (≤ +5 W typical); duration extensions may reach 5–10 % when within readiness thresholds  
- Progression logic must remain within validated fatigue safety ranges (ACWR ≤ 1.3, Monotony < 2.5)  
- When any progression variable changes, 7-day RI and TSB must remain within recovery-safe bands before further load increases  

---

### 9. Optional Performance Quality Metrics

When sufficient raw data is available, the AI may compute **secondary endurance quality markers** to evaluate training efficiency, durability, and fatigue resistance.  
These calculations must only occur with **explicit athlete-provided inputs** — not inferred or modeled values.  
Before interpretation, the AI must clearly state each metric’s **purpose**, **formula**, and **validation range**.

If metrics such as **ACWR**, **Strain**, **Monotony**, **FIR**, or **Polarization Ratio** exceed validated thresholds, the AI must flag potential overreaching or under-recovery **before** prescribing further load increases.  
Any training modification requires reconfirming **HRV**, **RHR**, and **subjective recovery status**.

#### Validated Optional Metrics

| **Metric**                | **Formula / Method**                                                    | **Target Range**   | **Purpose / Interpretation**                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HR–Power Decoupling (%)   | [(HR₂nd_half / Power₂nd_half) / (HR₁st_half / Power₁st_half) − 1] × 100 | < 5 %              | Aerobic efficiency metric; <5 % drift = stable HR–power coupling |
| Durability Index (DI)     | `Avg Power last hour ÷ Avg Power first hour`                            | ≥ 0.95             | Quantifies fatigue resistance during endurance sessions          |
| Fatigue Index Ratio (FIR) | `Best 20 min Power ÷ Best 60 min Power`                                 | 1.10 – 1.15        | Indicates sustainable power profile and fatigue decay            |
| FatOx Trend *(Optional)*  | Derived from HR–Power and substrate data                                | Stable or positive | Tracks metabolic efficiency and substrate adaptation             |
| Specificity Score         | Weighted match to goal event power/duration profile                     | ≥ 0.85             | Validates race-specific readiness (optional metric)              |

---

#### Load Management Metrics

| **Metric**          | **Formula / Method**                    | **Target Range** | **Purpose / Interpretation**                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Stress Tolerance    | `(Strain ÷ Monotony) ÷ 100`             | 3–6              | Quantifies capacity to absorb additional training load   |
| Load-Recovery Ratio | `7-day Load ÷ Recovery Index`           | <2.5             | **Secondary** overreach detector; complements RI and FIR |
| Consistency Index   | `Sessions Completed ÷ Sessions Planned` | ≥0.9             | Validates plan adherence and prescription compliance     |

**Interpretation Logic:**
- Stress Tolerance <3 → Limited buffer for load increases; prioritize recovery
- Stress Tolerance >6 → High absorption capacity; may tolerate progressive overload
- Load-Recovery Ratio ≥2.5 → Load outpacing recovery capacity; reduce volume or intensity

**⚠️ Metric Hierarchy:**  
These metrics are **secondary** to the primary readiness markers defined in Section 8 (Readiness & Recovery Thresholds). AI systems must evaluate in this order:

1. **Primary readiness:** RI, HRV, RHR, Feel
2. **Secondary load metrics:** Stress Tolerance, Load-Recovery Ratio, Consistency Index
3. **Tertiary diagnostics:** Zone Distribution Metrics, Durability Sub-Metrics, Capability Metrics (Aggregate Durability, TID Drift)

Do not override primary readiness signals with secondary load metrics.

---

#### Zone Distribution Metrics (Seiler's Polarized Model)

In addition to the polarisation ratios defined above in Zone Distribution & Polarisation Metrics, the following diagnostic metrics provide granular intensity distribution analysis aligned with Seiler's research.

**Critical Context:** Seiler's research shows that intensity distribution appears different depending on measurement method:
- **By session count:** ~80% easy sessions, ~20% hard sessions (polarized appearance)
- **By time in zone:** ~90%+ easy time, <10% hard time (pyramidal appearance)

Both measurements are valid but serve different purposes. For **high-volume athletes** (10+ hours/week), **session count or hard days per week** is often more practical than time-in-zone percentage.

| **Metric**                       | **Formula / Method**                    | **Purpose**                                               |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grey Zone Percentage**         | `Z3 Time ÷ Total Time × 100`            | Grey zone (tempo) monitoring — **minimize this**          |
| **Quality Intensity Percentage** | `(Z4+Z5+Z6+Z7) Time ÷ Total Time × 100` | Quality intensity — hard work above threshold             |
| **Polarisation Index**           | `(Z1+Z2) Time ÷ Total Time`             | Easy time ratio — validates 80/20 distribution by time    |
| **Hard Days per Week**           | Count of days with Z4+ work             | Session-based intensity tracking for high-volume athletes |

**Zone Classification (7-Zone to Seiler 3-Zone Mapping):**

| 7-Zone Model | Seiler Zone | Classification | Notes                                                     |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Z1–Z2        | Zone 1      | Easy           | Below LT1/VT1 (<2mM lactate)                              |
| Z3           | Zone 2      | Grey Zone      | Between LT1 and LT2 — "too much pain for too little gain" |
| Z4–Z7        | Zone 3      | Hard/Quality   | Above LT2/VT2 (>4mM lactate)                              |

**Intensity Distribution Targets:**

For athletes training **<10 hours/week** (time-based targets more practical):

| **Phase** | **Grey Zone % Target** | **Quality Intensity % Target** | **Polarisation Index** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| Base      | <5%                    | 10–15%                         | ≥0.85                  |
| Build     | <8%                    | 15–20%                         | ≥0.80                  |
| Peak      | <10%                   | 20–25%                         | ≥0.75                  |
| Recovery  | <3%                    | <5%                            | ≥0.95                  |

For athletes training **≥10 hours/week** (session-based targets more practical):

| **Phase** | **Grey Zone % Target** | **Hard Days/Week** | **Easy Days/Week** | **Rest Days** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| Base      | <5%                    | 1                  | 5–6                | 1             |
| Build     | <8%                    | 2                  | 4                  | 1             |
| Peak      | <10%                   | 2–3                | 3–4                | 1             |
| Recovery  | <3%                    | 0                  | 3–4                | 2–3           |

**Why Session Count Matters for High-Volume Athletes:**

When training 15+ hours per week, a 2-hour interval session might only contribute 5–7% of total weekly time in Z4+, despite being a full "hard day." By time-in-zone metrics, this looks insufficient. By session count, 2 hard days out of 6–7 training days (~30%) is appropriate for a build phase.

**Reference:** Seiler's research on elite cross-country skiers showed 77% of training sessions were easy and 23% were hard, while by time 91% was in zones 1–2 and only 9% in zones 3–5.

**AI Response Logic:**
- Grey Zone Percentage >8% for ≥2 consecutive weeks → Flag tempo creep; recommend restructuring
- Quality Intensity Percentage <10% AND Hard Days <2/week during build phase → Flag insufficient intensity stimulus
- Hard Days >3/week for ≥2 consecutive weeks → Flag overintensity risk; check RI and ACWR

**Example Valid Training Week (Build Phase, 15 hours total):**
- Monday: Rest + cross-training (walk, ski erg)
- Tuesday: Z2 endurance (2.5 hours)
- Wednesday: **Hard day** — VO2max intervals (1.5 hours, includes Z4+ work)
- Thursday: Z1–Z2 recovery/endurance (2 hours)
- Friday: Z2 endurance (2.5 hours)
- Saturday: **Hard day** — Threshold intervals (2 hours, includes Z4+ work)
- Sunday: Z2 long ride (4.5 hours)

This yields: ~3% Quality Intensity % by time, but 2 hard days (29% of training days) — both are correct measurements.

---

#### Grey Zone Percentage — Grey Zone Monitoring

To prevent unintended accumulation of tempo/threshold-adjacent intensity during base or recovery phases, monitor:

```
Grey Zone Percentage = Z3 Time ÷ Total Training Time × 100
```

**Phase-Appropriate Targets:**
| **Phase** | **Grey Zone % Target** | **Alert Threshold** |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Base      | <5%                    | >8%                 |
| Build     | <8%                    | >12%                |
| Peak      | <10%                   | >15%                |
| Recovery  | <3%                    | >5%                 |

**AI Response Logic:**
- Grey Zone Percentage exceeding alert threshold for ≥2 consecutive weeks → Flag tempo creep
- During base phase, elevated Grey Zone % often indicates insufficient Z1 volume or unstructured "junk miles"
- AI must recommend session restructuring to restore polarisation balance

**Why Z3 is the "Grey Zone":**

Per Seiler's research, training between the aerobic and anaerobic thresholds (tempo/sweetspot) generates:
- More fatigue than Z1–Z2 work
- Less adaptation stimulus than Z4+ work
- "Too much pain for too little gain"

Elite athletes consistently minimize Z3 exposure, favouring clear polarisation between easy (Z1–Z2) and hard (Z4+) sessions.

#### Periodisation & Progression Metrics

| **Metric**               | **Formula / Method**                | **Target Range** | **Purpose / Interpretation**                                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Specificity Volume Ratio | `Race-specific Hours ÷ Total Hours` | 0.7–0.9 (peak)   | Complements Specificity Score by tracking volume allocation toward event-specific work |
| Benchmark Index          | `(FTP_current ÷ FTP_prior) − 1`     | +2–5%            | Tracks longitudinal FTP progression without requiring formal tests                     |

**Interpretation Logic:**
- Specificity Volume Ratio <0.5 during peak phase → Insufficient race-specific volume (cross-check with Specificity Score for quality alignment)
- Benchmark Index negative over 8+ weeks → Investigate recovery, nutrition, or programming

**Note:** Specificity Volume Ratio measures *how much* training time is event-specific, while the existing Specificity Score measures *how well* sessions match target event demands. Both should trend upward during peak phases.

---

#### Durability Sub-Metrics

When Durability Index (DI) drops below 0.95, the following diagnostic metrics help identify the specific durability limitation:

| **Metric**      | **Formula / Method**                                           | **Target Range** | **Purpose / Interpretation**                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Endurance Decay | `(Avg Power Hour 1 − Avg Power Final Hour) ÷ Avg Power Hour 1` | <0.05            | Quantifies power degradation over long sessions  |
| Z2 Stability    | `SD(Z2 Power) ÷ Mean(Z2 Power)` across sessions                | <0.04            | Measures consistency of aerobic pacing execution |

**Diagnostic Logic:**
- High Endurance Decay + Normal HR–Power Decoupling → Muscular fatigue; consider fueling or pacing strategy
- Normal Endurance Decay + High HR–Power Decoupling → Cardiovascular drift; assess hydration, heat, or aerobic base fitness
- High Z2 Stability variance → Inconsistent pacing execution; review session targeting

**Note:** HR–Power Decoupling (existing metric) serves as the cardiac drift diagnostic. Do not duplicate with separate "Aerobic Decay" metric.

#### Aggregate Durability (Capability Metric)

The per-session Durability Sub-Metrics above diagnose *individual session* limitations. The **Aggregate Durability** metric provides a *trend-level* view of aerobic efficiency across multiple sessions, using HR–Power decoupling as the signal.

**Data Source:** The `capability.durability` object in the data mirror provides rolling 7-day and 28-day aggregate decoupling from qualifying steady-state sessions.

**Session Filter (all must be true):**
- HR–Power decoupling value exists (not null)
- Variability Index (VI) exists, > 0, and ≤ 1.05 (steady-state power only)
- Moving time ≥ 5400 seconds (90 minutes)

**Rationale:** Per Maunder et al. (2021) and Rothschild & Maunder (2025), meaningful cardiac drift requires prolonged exercise. The 90-minute floor is the practical field threshold where drift becomes detectable. The VI ≤ 1.05 filter excludes interval sessions where decoupling reflects recovery dynamics, not aerobic drift. Negative decoupling values are included — they indicate HR drifted down relative to power (strong durability or cooling conditions).

**Aggregate Metrics:**

| **Metric**               | **Description**                                           | **Minimum Data** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| mean_decoupling_7d       | Mean decoupling from qualifying sessions in last 7 days   | ≥ 2 sessions      |
| mean_decoupling_28d      | Mean decoupling from qualifying sessions in last 28 days  | ≥ 2 sessions      |
| high_drift_count_7d/28d  | Count of qualifying sessions with decoupling > 5%         | —                 |
| trend                    | 7d vs 28d comparison: improving / stable / declining      | Both windows      |

**Trend Logic:**
- `improving`: 7d mean < 28d mean by > 1 percentage point
- `stable`: 7d and 28d means within ±1 percentage point
- `declining`: 7d mean > 28d mean by > 1 percentage point

Trend direction matters more than absolute values — an athlete's baseline decoupling varies with fitness, conditions, and terrain.

**Alert Thresholds:**

| Condition                          | Severity | Action                                            |
|------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 28d mean > 5% (sustained)         | alarm    | Aerobic efficiency concern — review volume/recovery |
| 7d mean > 28d mean by > 2%        | warning  | Durability declining — check fatigue and recovery   |

| Durability Index (DI)    | **Complementary.** DI measures power output sustainability. Aggregate Durability measures cardiac efficiency trend. |
| HR–Power Decoupling      | **Aggregates.** Per-session decoupling is the raw input; aggregate durability provides the trend view.              |
| Endurance Decay          | **Different signal.** Endurance Decay = muscular. Aggregate Durability = cardiovascular drift.                     |

#### W′ Balance Metrics *(When Interval Data Available)*

If workout files include W′ balance data (from Intervals.icu or WKO), the following metrics provide anaerobic capacity insights:

| **Metric**             | **Definition**                                        | **Interpretation**                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Mean W′ Depletion      | Average % of W′ reserve expended per interval session | Higher values indicate greater anaerobic demand  |
| W′ Recovery Rate       | Time to recover 50% of W′ between intervals           | Slower recovery may indicate accumulated fatigue |
| Anaerobic Contribution | % of session TSS derived from W′ expenditure          | Validates interval prescription alignment        |

**Data Source & Requirements:**
- Intervals.icu automatically calculates CP (Critical Power) and W′ from your power curve data
- **However**, accurate modeling requires sufficient maximal efforts across multiple durations (typically 3–20 minutes) within the past 90 days
- If power curve data is sparse or lacks recent maximal efforts, CP/W′ estimates may be unreliable
- AI systems should verify `power_curve_quality` or equivalent confidence indicator before applying W′ metrics
- If CP/W′ data is unavailable or low-confidence, skip W′ metrics and rely on standard TSS-based load analysis

**Usage Notes:**
- These metrics are most relevant for VO₂max, threshold, and anaerobic interval sessions
- Do not apply to Z1–Z2 endurance sessions
- W′ metrics are **Tier 3 (tertiary)** — use for diagnostics, not primary load decisions

#### Metric Evaluation Hierarchy

To ensure AI systems evaluate metrics in the correct order:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Critical Rule:** Secondary metrics (Tier 2) must never override primary readiness signals (Tier 1). If RI ≥ 0.8 but Load-Recovery Ratio ≥ 2.5, flag for monitoring but do not auto-trigger deload.

#### Relationship to Existing Metrics

| New Metric                   | Existing Metric           | Relationship                                                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Load-Recovery Ratio          | Recovery Index (RI)       | **Hierarchical.** RI is primary readiness. Load-Recovery Ratio is secondary load-vs-recovery check.                                  |
| Load-Recovery Ratio          | Fatigue Index Ratio (FIR) | **Different purpose.** FIR measures power sustainability (20min vs 60min). Load-Recovery Ratio measures load vs recovery capacity.   |
| Specificity Volume Ratio     | Specificity Score         | **Complementary.** Volume Ratio tracks *how much* time is event-specific. Score tracks *how well* sessions match event demands.      |
| Endurance Decay              | Durability Index (DI)     | **Diagnostic breakdown.** DI is the primary metric. Endurance Decay provides detail when DI <0.95.                                   |
| Grey Zone Percentage         | Polarisation Index        | **Complementary.** Polarisation Index validates 80/20 by easy time. Grey Zone Percentage specifically flags grey zone creep.         |
| Quality Intensity Percentage | Polarisation Index        | **Complementary.** Quality Intensity Percentage tracks quality intensity. For high-volume athletes, Hard Days per Week is preferred. |
| Stress Tolerance             | Strain                    | **Derived from.** Stress Tolerance = (Strain ÷ Monotony) ÷ 100, providing absorption capacity context.                               |
| Aggregate Durability         | HR–Power Decoupling       | **Aggregates.** Per-session decoupling is the raw input; aggregate durability provides the 7d/28d trend view.                        |
| Aggregate Durability         | Durability Index (DI)     | **Complementary.** DI = power output sustainability. Aggregate Durability = cardiovascular efficiency trend across sessions.          |
| Seiler TID (Treff PI)        | Polarisation Index        | **Different scale.** Simple Polarisation Index = 0–1 easy-time ratio. Treff PI = logarithmic scale with 5-class classification.      |
| TID Drift                    | Seiler TID                | **Temporal comparison.** TID Drift compares 7d vs 28d Seiler TID to detect distribution shifts over time.                            |

### Update & Version Guidance

The dossier (DOSSIER.md) and SECTION_11.md is the **single source of truth** for all thresholds, metrics, and structural logic.  
AI systems must **never overwrite base data** — all updates require **explicit athlete confirmation**.  

When new inputs are provided (e.g., FTP test, updated HRV, weight), the AI must assist with **structured version-control** (e.g., `v0.7.5 → v0.7.6`).

---

### Feedback Loop Architecture *(RPS-Style)*

- **Weekly loop** → Review CTL, ATL, TSB, DI, HRV, RHR, aggregate durability trend, TID drift; adjust load accordingly.  
- **Feed-forward** → AI or athlete modifies next week’s volume/intensity based on readiness.  
- **Block loop (3–4 weeks)** → Evaluate durability trend (by-week trajectory), TID at block scale, readiness; determine phase transitions.

> Training progression must reflect **physiological adaptation**, not fixed calendar timing.

---

### AI Interaction Template

If uncertain about data integrity, the AI must default to the following confirmation sequence:

> “To ensure accurate recommendations, please confirm:  
> - Current FTP / LT2  
> - Latest HRV and RHR  
> - Current CTL, ATL, and Form (from Intervals.icu)  
> - Any illness, soreness, or recovery issues this week?”

All recommendations must reference **only verified data**.  
If new metrics are imported from external platforms (e.g., Whoop, Oura, HRV4Training), record the source and timestamp — but retain **Intervals.icu** as the Tier-0 data reference.

---

### Goal Alignment Reference

All AI recommendations must remain aligned with the athlete’s **long-term roadmap** (see *Section 3: Training Schedule & Framework*).  
The dossier’s performance-objective tables define the **authoritative phase structure** and **KPI trajectory** guiding progression and adaptation.

---

### Output Format Guidelines

AI systems should structure athlete reports consistently.  
See https://github.com/CrankAddict/section-11/tree/main/examples/reports for annotated templates and examples.

**Pre-Workout Reports must include:**
- Weather and coach note (if athlete location is available)
- Readiness assessment (HRV, RHR, Sleep vs baselines)
- Load context (TSB, ACWR, Load/Recovery, Monotony if > 2.3)
- Capability snapshot (Durability 7d mean + trend; TID drift if not consistent)
- Today's planned workout with duration and targets (or rest day + next session preview)
- Go/Modify/Skip recommendation with rationale

See `PRE_WORKOUT_TEMPLATE.md` in the examples directory for conditional fields and readiness decision logic.

**Post-Workout Reports must include:**
- One-line session summary
- Completed session metrics (power, HR, zones, decoupling, VI, TSS vs planned)
- Plan compliance assessment
- Weekly running totals (polarization, durability 7d/28d + trend, TID 28d + drift, CTL, ATL, TSB, ACWR, hours, TSS)
- Overall coach note (2-4 sentences: compliance, key quality observations, load context, recovery note)

See `POST_WORKOUT_TEMPLATE.md` in the examples directory for field reference and rounding conventions.

**Brevity Rule:** Brief when metrics are normal. Detailed when thresholds are breached or athlete asks "why."

**Alerts Array:** If an `alerts` array is present in the JSON data mirror, AI systems must evaluate all alerts and respond to any with severity `"warning"` or `"alarm"` before proceeding with standard analysis. Empty alerts array = green light, no mention needed.

**Confidence Scoring:** The data mirror may include `history_confidence` (longitudinal depth) and `data_confidence` (current data completeness) fields. AI systems should use these internally to calibrate recommendation certainty. Do not surface confidence to the athlete unless it materially limits the quality of advice (e.g., phase detection impossible without history).

## 11 B. AI Training Plan Protocol

**Purpose:**  
Define deterministic, phase-aligned rules for AI or automated systems that generate or modify training plans, ensuring consistency with the dossier’s endurance framework, physiological safety, and audit traceability.

---

### 1 — Phase Alignment
Identify the current macro-phase (**Base → Build → Peak → Taper → Recovery**) using:
- **TSB trend**, **RI trend**, and **ACWR range (0.8 – 1.3)**  
- Active-phase objectives defined in *Section 3 — Training Schedule & Framework*  

Generated plans must explicitly state the detected phase in their audit header.

---

### 2 — Volume Ceiling Validation
- Weekly training hours may fluctuate ±10 % around the athlete’s validated baseline (~15 h).  
- Expansions beyond this range require **RI ≥ 0.8 for ≥ 7 days** and HRV stability within ±10 % of baseline.  
- Any week exceeding this threshold must flag  
  `"load_variance": true` in the audit metadata.

---

### 3 — Intensity Distribution Control
- Maintain **polarisation ≈ 0.8 (80 / 20)** across the microcycle.  
- **Z3+ (≥ LT2)** time ≤ 20 % of total moving duration.  
- **Z1–Z2** time ≥ 75 % of total duration.  
- Over-threshold accumulation outside these bounds triggers automatic plan validation error.

---

### 4 — Session Composition Rules
- **2 structured sessions/week** (Sweet Spot or VO₂ max)  
- **1 long Z2 durability ride**  
- Remaining sessions = Z1–Z2 recovery or aerobic maintenance  
- Back-to-back high-intensity days prohibited unless **TSB > 0 and RI ≥ 0.85**

---

### 5 — Progression Integration
Only one progression vector may change per week **unless**:
- Pathways 1+2 (Duration + Interval): permitted if RI ≥ 0.8, HRV within 10%, no negative fatigue trend
- Pathways 2+3 (Interval + Environmental): permitted if RI ≥ 0.85, HRV stable, no recent load spikes
- Pathways 1+3 (Duration + Environmental): **never permitted**

---

### 6 — Audit Metadata (Required Header)

Every generated or modified plan must embed machine-readable metadata for audit and reproducibility:

```json
{
  "data_source_fetched": true,
  "json_fetch_status": "success",
  "plan_version": "auto",
  "phase": "Build",
  "week": 3,
  "load_target_TSS": 520,
  "volume_hours": 15.2,
  "polarization_ratio": 0.81,
  "progression_vector": "duration",
  "load_variance": false,
  "validation_protocol": "URF_v5.1",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

---

Interpretation:
This header documents provenance, deterministic context, and planning logic for downstream validation under Section 11 C — AI Validation Protocol.

### 7 — Compliance & Error Handling

Plans breaching tolerance limits must not publish until validated.

AI systems must output an explicit reason string for rejections, e.g.:
"error": "ACWR > 1.35 — exceeds safe progression threshold"

Human-review override requires athlete confirmation and metadata flag "override": true.

## Summary

This protocol ensures that any AI engaging with athlete data provides structured, evidence-based, non-speculative, and deterministic endurance coaching.

**If uncertain — ask, confirm, and adapt rather than infer.**

This ensures numerical integrity, auditability, and consistent long-term performance alignment with athlete objectives.

> This protocol draws on concepts from the **Intervals.icu GPT Coaching Framework** (Clive King, revo2wheels) and the **Unified Reporting Framework v5.1**, with particular reference to stress tolerance, zone distribution indexing, and tiered audit validation approaches. Special thanks to **David Tinker** (Intervals.icu) and **Clive King** for their foundational work enabling open endurance data access and AI coaching integration.
